SYNOPSIS
    login

DESCRIPTION
    login is used when signing onto a system. 

    login prompts for the username and the password, where appropriate.
    Echoing is disabled to prevent revealing the password.

    The user and group ID will be set according to their values in the
    /etc/passwd file.

    The greeting message from the file /etc/motd is printed and the
    user shell specified in /etc/passwd is started.
