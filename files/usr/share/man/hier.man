NAME
    hier - description of the filesystem hierarchy

DESCRIPTION
    The filesystem is structured like a typical Linux system and more or less
    resembles the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard by the Linux Foundation.

    The filesystem has among others the following directories:

    /      This is the root directory.  This is where the whole tree starts.

    /bin   This directory contains basic and required executable programs.

    /dev   Special or device files, which refer to physical devices.

    /etc   Contains system-wide configuration files of the machine.

    /home  Contains the home directories for individual users.

    /proc  This is the mount point for the proc filesystem, which provides
           information about running processes and the kernel.

    /root  This directory is the home directory for the root user.

    /usr/bin
           This is the directory for additional executable programs.

    /usr/srv
           Contains the source code used to build the system.

    /usr/share
           Contains subdirectories with specific application data, that can be shared
           among different architectures of the same OS.

    /usr/share/man
           Manual pages go here.

    /var   Contains files which may change in size.

    /var/lib
           Variable state information for programs.
